<h1>Tuple</h1>
<p1> Tuples are very similar to lists, as they are heterogeneous. But unlike lists, tuples are not immutable (can not be changed). </p1>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p1>Access is an o(1) operation, just like an array, it is only one operation as they are all continuous in memory. Tuples do not allow insertion or deletion, as they are immutable</p1>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p1> Why use a tuple instead of a list, or array? Tuples are better when information is known for whats going into the structure. For example, when you want to store a NFL players stats</p1>
<h2>Example</h2>
phillip_rivers = ('4000','50','78')
